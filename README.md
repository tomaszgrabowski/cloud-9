# Helo Cloud-9!

This is a simple app you wanted me to do as a part of an interview process.

#How to

To run it simply type `yarn start` in a terminal.

#Some additional information
To speed up development process I've used css framework called `Tailwind`. Some components may look a slightly different that in design.
To fully match design I would use `css modules` or `StyledComponents` but this time, time was crucial for me. 

I'm open for any questions or discussion.
